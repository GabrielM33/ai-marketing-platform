I need an AI agent that

- reads all my X-Dms
- researches the sender's credibility
- makes a judgement if its a good opportunity
- if yes , notifies me

So much shit in my Dms.

Do you think I can do this using n8n?

Yes, you can use n8n to build a workflow that achieves this, but you'll likely need to combine it with other tools or APIs to handle specific tasks like credibility assessment and AI-driven judgment. Here’s how you can break it down:

Steps to Build the Workflow in n8n
Integrate X (Twitter) API:

Use n8n's HTTP Request node to connect to the X API. You'll need to get an API key and set up access to read your DMs.
Fetch DMs periodically (e.g., every 10 minutes) and process each message.
Extract and Clean Message Data:

Use the Set or Function nodes in n8n to extract and structure relevant parts of the DMs, like sender username, message text, and other metadata.
Research Sender Credibility:

Use APIs like:
Clearbit: To get enriched data about the sender, such as their company, position, and social profiles.
Hunter.io: To verify the email associated with the sender if available.
Social Media Scraping: Use the X API or services like Pipedream to fetch public activity, followers, and other social credibility markers.
n8n can call these APIs using the HTTP Request node.
Evaluate Credibility and Opportunity:

For the "judgment" step, connect an external AI model:
Use OpenAI or another LLM via n8n’s OpenAI node or an HTTP request to GPT models.
Provide the AI with context like the sender's credibility metrics, message content, and your past preferences for opportunities.
Example prompt:
plaintext
Copy code
Analyze this incoming DM and the sender's profile. Determine if this message is a credible business opportunity for [Gabriel, solopreneur]. Respond with "Good Opportunity" or "Not a Good Opportunity" and a brief reason.
Notify You on Good Opportunities:

Use the Telegram or Email node in n8n to send you notifications when an opportunity passes your filters.
Include details like the sender's username, message, and the AI's reasoning.
Challenges to Consider
Rate Limits:
The X API has strict rate limits, especially for fetching DMs. Ensure your workflow respects these limits.
Credibility Data:
Tools like Clearbit or Hunter.io often require paid plans for detailed data.
Custom Filters:
Tailoring the AI prompt and evaluation logic to your specific needs may take iteration.
Data Privacy:
Ensure the system respects privacy regulations like GDPR if you're storing or analyzing personal data.
Why n8n Works Well
Customizability: You can set up complex, multi-step workflows integrating different APIs and services.
Low-Code: Easily integrate third-party tools without extensive programming.
Automation: Once set up, the process runs autonomously.
Alternative Tools
If n8n feels too complex for some of these tasks, you can complement or replace parts of it with:

Zapier/Make for simpler automation.
LangChain for more advanced AI-driven judgment with tools integration.
Pipedream for API-heavy automation workflows.

Here's a step-by-step n8n workflow design for your AI agent that processes X (Twitter) DMs, evaluates sender credibility, and notifies you of good opportunities.

Workflow Overview
Trigger: Periodically fetch DMs using the X API.
Data Processing: Extract relevant message details (e.g., sender handle, message content).
Sender Research: Enrich sender data with third-party APIs.
AI Evaluation: Use GPT (or another LLM) to evaluate the credibility and opportunity value.
Notification: Send notifications for good opportunities.
Step-by-Step Workflow in n8n

1. Trigger: Fetch DMs from X (Twitter)
   Node Type: HTTP Request
   Purpose: Fetch the latest DMs using the X API.
   Configuration:
   URL: https://api.twitter.com/2/direct_messages/events/list
   Headers: Include your Bearer Token from the X API.
   Add parameters to fetch only new messages since the last execution.
   Output: A list of DMs, including sender info, message text, and timestamps.
2. Process and Filter Messages
   Node Type: Function
   Purpose: Extract relevant data (e.g., sender username, message content) and filter out duplicates or irrelevant messages.
   Sample Code:
   javascript
   Copy code
   const messages = items.map(item => {
   return {
   sender: item.json.message_create.sender_id,
   text: item.json.message_create.message_data.text,
   timestamp: item.json.created_timestamp
   };
   });

return messages; 3. Enrich Sender Data
Node Type: HTTP Request (Clearbit, Hunter.io, or other tools)
Purpose: Fetch sender's credibility and enrichment data.
Steps:
Use Clearbit’s Enrichment API or similar:
URL: https://person.clearbit.com/v2/people/find
Parameters: Email, social handle, or name (if available).
Headers: Include your Clearbit API key.
Store details like:
Company
Role/Position
Social media presence
Output: Credibility metrics (followers, company name, etc.). 4. Evaluate Credibility and Opportunity (AI Judgment)
Node Type: OpenAI (or HTTP Request for custom GPT calls)
Purpose: Use AI to decide if the message is a good opportunity.
Prompt Example:
plaintext
Copy code
Analyze this message and sender data:
Message: "{{text}}"
Sender Info:

- Username: {{sender}}
- Followers: {{followers}}
- Company: {{company}}
- Role: {{role}}

Determine if this is a good business opportunity. Respond with:

1. "Good Opportunity" or "Not a Good Opportunity"
2. A brief explanation.
   Input Variables: Populate sender and message details dynamically from previous nodes.
   Output: AI decision and reasoning.
3. Notify on Good Opportunities
   Node Type: Telegram/Email Node
   Purpose: Notify you when the AI identifies a good opportunity.
   Configuration:
   If AI response includes "Good Opportunity," send a message with:
   Sender's username.
   Original message.
   AI explanation.
   Example Email/Telegram Text:
   plaintext
   Copy code
   New Opportunity Found!

- Sender: @{{sender}}
- Message: "{{text}}"
- Reason: "{{AI_reason}}"
  Connecting the Workflow
  Nodes and Connections:

HTTP Request (Fetch DMs) → Function (Extract Message Details)
Function → HTTP Request (Clearbit or Credibility API)
Credibility API → OpenAI Node (AI Judgment)
OpenAI Node → Conditional Node (Filter "Good Opportunities")
Conditional Node → Notification Node (Telegram/Email)
Execution Frequency:

Use a Cron Node to execute the workflow periodically (e.g., every 10-15 minutes).
Optional Enhancements
Store Data:

Use a database like Airtable or Google Sheets to log processed messages and decisions for auditing or debugging.
Train a Custom AI Model:

Fine-tune GPT or another model on your preferences to improve accuracy over time.
Rate Limiting:

Ensure the workflow respects X API and Clearbit rate limits to avoid errors.
